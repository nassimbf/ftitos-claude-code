# Continuous Learning v2.1 - Instinct-Based Architecture

An advanced learning system that turns your Claude Code sessions into reusable knowledge through atomic "instincts" -- small learned behaviors with confidence scoring.

## When to Activate

- Setting up automatic learning from Claude Code sessions
- Configuring instinct-based behavior extraction via hooks
- Tuning confidence thresholds for learned behaviors
- Reviewing, exporting, or importing instinct libraries
- Evolving instincts into full skills, commands, or agents
- Managing project-scoped vs global instincts

## The Instinct Model

An instinct is a small learned behavior:

```yaml
---
id: prefer-functional-style
trigger: "when writing new functions"
confidence: 0.7
domain: "code-style"
source: "session-observation"
scope: project
---

# Prefer Functional Style

## Action
Use functional patterns over classes when appropriate.

## Evidence
- Observed 5 instances of functional pattern preference
- User corrected class-based approach to functional
```

**Properties:**
- **Atomic** -- one trigger, one action
- **Confidence-weighted** -- 0.3 = tentative, 0.9 = near certain
- **Domain-tagged** -- code-style, testing, git, debugging, workflow, etc.
- **Evidence-backed** -- tracks what observations created it
- **Scope-aware** -- `project` (default) or `global`

## How It Works

```
Session Activity (in a git repo)
      |
      | Hooks capture prompts + tool use (100% reliable)
      | + detect project context (git remote / repo path)
      v
+---------------------------------------------+
|  observations.jsonl (per-project or global)  |
+---------------------------------------------+
      |
      | Observer agent reads (background, Haiku)
      v
+---------------------------------------------+
|          PATTERN DETECTION                   |
|   * User corrections -> instinct             |
|   * Error resolutions -> instinct            |
|   * Repeated workflows -> instinct           |
|   * Scope decision: project or global?       |
+---------------------------------------------+
      |
      | Creates/updates instincts
      v
+---------------------------------------------+
|  instincts/personal/ (project or global)     |
+---------------------------------------------+
      |
      | /evolve clusters + /promote
      v
+---------------------------------------------+
|  evolved/ (skills, commands, agents)         |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Enable Observation Hooks

Add to your settings.json:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "path/to/skills/continuous-learning-v2/hooks/observe.sh"
      }]
    }],
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "path/to/skills/continuous-learning-v2/hooks/observe.sh"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### 2. Use the Instinct Commands

```bash
/instinct-status     # Show learned instincts (project + global)
/evolve              # Cluster related instincts into skills/commands
/instinct-export     # Export instincts to file
/instinct-import     # Import instincts from others
/promote             # Promote project instincts to global scope
/projects            # List all known projects and their instinct counts
```

## Scope Decision Guide

| Pattern Type | Scope | Examples |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Language/framework conventions | **project** | "Use React hooks", "Follow Django REST patterns" |
| File structure preferences | **project** | "Tests in `__tests__`/", "Components in src/components/" |
| Code style | **project** | "Use functional style", "Prefer dataclasses" |
| Security practices | **global** | "Validate user input", "Sanitize SQL" |
| General best practices | **global** | "Write tests first", "Always handle errors" |
| Tool workflow preferences | **global** | "Grep before Edit", "Read before Write" |
| Git practices | **global** | "Conventional commits", "Small focused commits" |

## Confidence Scoring

| Score | Meaning | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 0.3 | Tentative | Suggested but not enforced |
| 0.5 | Moderate | Applied when relevant |
| 0.7 | Strong | Auto-approved for application |
| 0.9 | Near-certain | Core behavior |

**Confidence increases** when:
- Pattern is repeatedly observed
- User doesn't correct the suggested behavior
- Similar instincts from other sources agree

**Confidence decreases** when:
- User explicitly corrects the behavior
- Pattern isn't observed for extended periods
- Contradicting evidence appears

## Instinct Promotion (Project -> Global)

When the same instinct appears in multiple projects with high confidence, it's a candidate for promotion to global scope.

**Auto-promotion criteria:**
- Same instinct ID in 2+ projects
- Average confidence >= 0.8

## Privacy

- Observations stay **local** on your machine
- Project-scoped instincts are isolated per project
- Only **instincts** (patterns) can be exported -- not raw observations
- No actual code or conversation content is shared
- You control what gets exported and promoted
